# Components planning

## - TaskCreator

### Need?

This requires a form with an input and a button, as well as a Props to receive the function from the parent component (App).

### Responsability?

Get and save the input value in an array (for the Task component) from the click of the submit button.

### Changes?

There are no changes in this component. It will serve as a collector of the data that users enter in input and send it for Task Component.

## - TaskFilter

### Need?

This needs parent function that allows organizing (and filtering) TaskList items.

### Responsability?

It will organise the items it receives from the parent component (in this case, the data received after the changes made to TaskFilter).

### Changes?

No changes will be made to this component, however, it will be the component that causes the TaskList component to output in an organised manner from the App parent component.
